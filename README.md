### My Stack
I'm a Full Stack Junior Developer and here are the technologies that I work with and learn about almost every day:
- **.NET C#**: I've worked with Blazor using .NET 8 and minimal APIs using only C# in the back-end. I'm also learning about unit tests, usually working with Xunit and Shoudly. I've also used .NET to build MVC, Console, Web Forms and Windows Service (using a Background Worker) applications.
- **React**: I usually work with the React Framework Next.js or Vite.js, with mobile I used to develop apps using pure React Native, but I try to use Expo now with the Bare Workflow.
- **yarn**: When I need to build a monorepo I use yarn workspaces almost all the time, it is also the package manager that I use the most.
- **Docker**: I try to use containers on my projects as much as I can, but still learning a lot about it.
- **Database**: Most of the time I'm using relational databases such as SQL Server and MySql, but I'd like to learn about MongoDB and graph databases.  
- **SQL**: With SQL I'm able to execute the basic commands, in my personal projects I never user triggers, stored procedures or any type of programming in the database. 
 
### Learning Journy
I try to learn design patterns, architectures, concepts and try to apply them in the stack that I use, every now and then I try and test different technologies, but always keep myself focused on the stack that I know more.

### Fun Fact
I like to play guitar and have a lot of interest in game development.
